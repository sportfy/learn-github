# 1. Estimating how different sectors' inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) will affect Malaysia's economy

## What: 
This topic focuses on estimating how Malaysia's economy would be affected by FDI inflows by sector by forecasting future GDP movements and analyzing the relationship between various FDI industries and Malaysia's GDP. 

## Why:
The reason to focus on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as a component in this research is because FDI is a strong crucial factor in a country's economic growth based on the previous articles. It has been recognized as a significant source of external finance for both developing and developed countries. FDI is known to promote economic growth by enhancing domestic capital formation, facilitating the transfer of new technology, and providing long-term economic stability. Additionally, FDI has been found to have a positive impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in various countries, making it an important variable to study in the context of economic forecasting and analysis.

## How:
Artificial neural networks (ANN), multiple linear regression and ARIMA are two examples of statistical models using machine learning that will be used in this research.

## Data:
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data.
2. Foreign Direct Investment FDI: agriculture, forestry and fishing, mining and quarrying, construction, manufacturing, and selected services.

## Objective:
1. Identify which sectors in the FDI inflows have a significant relationship with Malaysia's GDP using Multiple Linear Regression.
2. Determine the most accurate model for forecasting GDP among Multiple Linear Regression, ARIMAX, MLR-ANN Hybrid, and ARIMAX-ANN Hybrid models.
3. Predict/forecast Malaysia's GDP by simulating each sector in FDI inflows using Monte Carlo Simulation and forecasting models.





# 2. Cashless Payment Adoption in Malaysia:  A Quantitative Approach

## What: 
This topics focus on how countries compete to demonstrate technological advancement as an indicator of development, particularly focusing on how technology raises living standards and improves countries' economies. Therefore, compared to certain other nations, Malaysia is said to have a somewhat low adoption rate for cashless payment methods. In Malaysia, cash is still used for a big percentage of transactions even though there are a lot of credit and debit cards in use. Furthermore, it has been observed that Malaysia's e-wallet adoption rate is still low, which has been identified as a barrier to the country's goal of becoming a cashless society.

## Why: 

1. Lack of Knowledge: A large number of Malaysians may prefer traditional cash transactions because they are unaware of the advantages and convenience of cashless payment methods.

2. Limited Acceptance by Retailers: Although the use of mobile devices is growing, some Malaysian retailers have not completely embraced cashless or digital payment methods, which may impede the general adoption of these strategies.

3. Consumer Behaviour: Due to habits or worries about security and privacy when it comes to digital transactions, some customers may still prefer to make cash transactions.

4. Regulatory Environment: The rate at which cashless payment methods are adopted in Malaysia may be impacted by the necessity of strengthening national laws and policies to support electronic commerce and guarantee the security of cashless transactions.

## How:
The quantitative methodology is because a lot of research uses qualitative methods to analyze the adoption of cashless payment. This approach also helps to provide an organized and methodical way to research Malaysia's adoption of cashless payment systems.

## Data:
1. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM)'s Financial Stability and Payment Systems Report.
The data have several components, including the GDP, cash in circulation, checks, and electronic payments, which are included in the statistics. Internet banking, mobile banking, rapid transfer, and electronic money (e-money) are all examples of e-payment tools. 

## Objective:
1. What is the performance of cashless payment in Malaysia?
2. What is the relationship between the cashless economy and economic growth in Malaysia?
3. Which one dominates between cashless payment and cash in circulation in Malaysia?
