## Github Profile üëã
A GitHub profile is a public facing page that displays a user's activity on the platform. It includes information such as the user's username, profile picture, bio, location, and links to their website or social media profiles.

The main focus of a GitHub profile is the user's repositories. Repositories are collections of files that contain a project or a portion of a project. On a GitHub profile, users can showcase their repositories, which can be sorted by type (public or private), language, and date. Each repository includes information such as the name, description, number of stars (a measure of popularity), and the number of forks (when someone makes a copy of the repository to make their own changes).

GitHub profiles also include information on a user's contributions to open source projects. GitHub tracks contributions such as pull requests (code changes that are proposed for review and merging into a project), issues (problem reports or feature requests), and comments.

Another important aspect of a GitHub profile is the user's activity feed. This shows a chronological list of the user's recent activity on the platform, such as repositories they have starred or issues they have commented on.

GitHub profiles are a great way for developers to showcase their skills and projects to potential employers or collaborators. By maintaining an active and well-curated profile, developers can establish themselves as experts in their field and attract new opportunities.
