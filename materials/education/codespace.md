# Github Education: Codespaces

## History
GitHub Codespaces was introduced by GitHub in 2020 as a cloud-based development environment that allows developers to write, review, and ship code directly from their web browser or integrated development environment (IDE). It provides a fully configured development environment in the cloud, eliminating the need for developers to set up and maintain local development environments.

Before the launch of GitHub Codespaces, developers typically had to set up their local development environments with the necessary dependencies, tools, and configurations. This process often involved complex installation procedures and could be time-consuming, especially when working with multiple projects or collaborating with other developers.

GitHub Codespaces aimed to simplify this process and provide developers with a consistent and reproducible development environment that could be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. By moving the development environment to the cloud, developers could save time on initial setup, easily switch between projects, and collaborate more seamlessly with others.

</p>

The history of GitHub Codespaces can be traced back to Visual Studio Codespaces, which was initially introduced by Microsoft as Visual Studio Online in 2019. Visual Studio Codespaces provided a similar cloud-based development environment but was primarily focused on Visual Studio IDE users.

GitHub, being a subsidiary of Microsoft, leveraged the technology behind Visual Studio Codespaces and integrated it into their platform to create GitHub Codespaces. This integration brought the benefits of cloud-based development environments to the GitHub ecosystem, allowing developers to work on their GitHub repositories directly from the browser or their preferred IDE, including Visual Studio Code.

## What is a Codespaces?
A codespaces is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. You can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by committing configuration files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.

Each codespaces you create is hosted by GitHub in a Docker container, running on a virtual machine. You can choose from a selection of virtual machine types, from 2 cores, 8 GB RAM, and 32 GB storage, up to 32 cores, 64 GB RAM, and 128 GB storage.

By default, codespaces are created from an Ubuntu Linux image that includes a selection of popular languages and tools, but you can use an image based on a Linux distribution of your choice and configure it for your particular requirements. Regardless of your local operating system, your codespace will run in a Linux environment. Windows and MacOS are not supported operating systems for the remote container.

You can connect to your codespaces from your browser, from Visual Studio Code, from the JetBrains Gateway application, or by using GitHub CLI. When you connect, you are placed within the Docker container. You do not have access to the outer Linux virtual machine host.
